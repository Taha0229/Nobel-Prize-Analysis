Nobel Prize Analysis:
In this data science project, I tried to analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize to see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what we can learn about the Nobel Prize and our world more generally.
The project had the following objectives:
1. Percentage of Male vs. Female Laureates

3. Repeated winners
4. 
5. Number of prizes per category

The data was visualised using multiple charts, like **donut pie charts**, **bar charts**, **scatter plots** along with **line charts**, **horizontal bar charts**, **chloropleth maps**, **sunburst charts**, **histograms**, and **box plots.**
Languages and Tools: **Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Google Colab.**
