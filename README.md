Nobel Prize Analysis:
In this data science project, I tried to analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize to see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what we can learn about the Nobel Prize and our world more generally.
The project had the following objectives:
1. Percentage of Male vs. Female Laureates
2. Repeated winners
3. Number of prizes per category
4. Male and Female Winners by Category
5. Are more prizes awarded recently than when the prize was first created?
6. Are more prizes shared than before?
7. The countries with the most Nobel Prizes
8. In which categories are the different countries winning prizes?
9. Number of prizes won by each country over time, and when did the USA go ahead of other countries?
10. What are the top research organisations?
and many more.


The data was visualised using multiple charts, like **donut pie charts**, **bar charts**, **scatter plots** along with **line charts**, **horizontal bar charts**, **chloropleth maps**, **sunburst charts**, **histograms**, and **box plots.**
Languages and Tools: **Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Google Colab.**
